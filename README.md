Ngai's Call: A Journey of Kikuyu Wisdom

Welcome to Ngai's Call, a captivating 2D top-down game built with Flutter and the Flame engine. Embark on a spiritual journey through a vibrant forest, collecting ancient Kikuyu wisdom while evading the ominous red spirits that seek to thwart your path. Can you survive the trials and gather enough wisdom to honor the ancestors?
Features

    Dynamic Enemy Behavior: Red spirits, representing adverse forces, patrol the forest. They'll wander peacefully until you get too close, at which point they'll intensely pursue you!

    Player Life System: Your journey is fraught with peril. Getting caught by spirits drains your life slowly, adding a layer of suspense and strategy.

    Spiritual Energy & Protection: Collect blessings (green orbs) to replenish your spiritual energy. Use this energy to activate Ngai's Protection (a temporary shield) to safely pass through enemy spirits.

    Hideout Trapping Mechanism: Discover sacred Hideouts scattered throughout the forest. Lure pursuing enemies into these hideouts, and your fellow Mau Mau fighters will ambush them, rewarding you with points and energy.

    Collectables:

        Blessings (Green): Restore spiritual energy.

        Kikuyu Proverbs (Purple): Grant wisdom and provide ancient sayings as messages.

        Ancestor Spirits (Gold): Offer significant energy and a temporary blessing, boosting your speed and making you impervious to enemies.

    Immersive Atmosphere: Experience the forest through custom canvas-based graphics, with no external images or sprites, creating a unique visual style.

    Dramatic Entrance & Exit: Enjoy a thematic splash screen to begin your journey and a powerful game-over experience that encourages you to play again.
